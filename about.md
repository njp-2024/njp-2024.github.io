I'm Nick — a software engineer focused on building practical tools and systems.

I am an Officer in the United States Marine Corps, nearing retirement in 2028.  I have 18 years of experience leading teams, managing complex
operations, and making decisions under constraints.  That experience has shaped how I think about problems: define them clearly, weigh tradeoffs honestly, and build something that works.

Now I'm applying that approach to software to help the Marine Corps modernize. I'm drawn to work that involves automation, data analysis, and systems design — building things that reduce friction and make processes more reliable. I value clean architecture, readable code, and solutions that are maintainable over time.

I'm currently focused on expanding my technical skills and contributing to teams that care about building well. If you'd like to connect, you can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/njp-2024) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/your-profile).
