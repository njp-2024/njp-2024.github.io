<div class="prose" markdown="1">

I'm Nicholas Persaud — a software engineer focused on building practical tools and systems.

My background is in the United States Marine Corps, where I spent several years leading teams, managing complex operations, and making decisions under constraints. That experience shaped how I think about problems: define them clearly, weigh tradeoffs honestly, and build something that works.

Now I'm applying that approach to software. I'm drawn to work that involves automation, data analysis, and systems design — building things that reduce friction and make processes more reliable. I value clean architecture, readable code, and solutions that are maintainable over time.

I'm currently focused on expanding my technical skills and contributing to teams that care about building well. If you'd like to connect, you can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/njp-2024) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/your-profile).
