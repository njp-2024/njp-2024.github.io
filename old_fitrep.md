# FitRep Calculator

**The FitRep Calculator** is a modernization tool for the USMC Performance Evaluation System (PES).

### The Problem
Reporting Seniors don't get to see the relative values for reports they write.  Section I comments not being alligned to relative value is a common complaint.

### The Solution
1. The tool allows RS's to preview relative values for reports prior to submitting, quickly and easily.
2. LLM integration assists the RS in drafting section I comments that align with the relative value.
