# Welcome

I am a Marine and CS student/hobbyist focused on modernizing legacy workflows with software, AI, and web technologies.

## Projects

### 1. FitRep Calculator (USMC)
**Status:** Live | **Stack:** Python, Streamlit, AI

A decision-support tool designed to assist USMC Reporting Seniors (RS) in preparing Fitness Reports. It addresses two critical needs:

1.  **Relative Value (RV) Forecasting:** Allows an RS to see how a specific set of attribute marks will impact a report's Relative Value (RV) and Cumulative RV *before* submitting the report.
2.  **Section I Narrative Generation:** Leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist Reporting Seniors in drafting Section I comments that align in tone and language with the relative value of the report(s).

### 2. Coming Soon
**Status:** In Development | **Stack:** TBD

I am working on some ideas.
